I created this repository just because I do not like the Gist interface, and
Pastebin do not have version control.

files:

* `Makefile`: user defined functions I may use in the future
* [`bitbucket-issue-clean.user.js`](bitbucket-issue-clean.user.js?raw=true): a
  script that removes useless "+1" comments.
