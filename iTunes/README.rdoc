= Tool Convert iTunes Database to XML

iTunes local database can be exported as a property list. This program
translates the property list into nice XML. It accepts the property list either
as a command line argument, or as standard input if the argument is missing; it
prints the XML to standard output. Errors, if any, are printed to standard
error. Example usage:

  $ ruby main.rb < database.plist > database.xml
